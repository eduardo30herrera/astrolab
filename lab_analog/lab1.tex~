\title{Lab Report 1: Impedence, Filters, Amplifiers, and Noise}
\author{Eduardo Herrera}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this lab, we were to use electronic components to create
components to analyze and combine with appropriate values to get proper
measurements of their effect on elctronic signals and how these effects
could be used to build a circuit that could receive an fm transmission,
and other uses in the latter weeks. At times there were missing or malfunctoning components
that prevented some measurements from being taken, so in the case of
missing components of certain values, we (meaning Marta
and I, the others
in our group were behind and so could not contribute) then used other
values that were close to our calculated values to get closer to desired
results. In following week, we then combined our fm receiver with other
circuits to create an amplifier, with a greater knowledge of our circuit
components. Our
most important findings regarded the effect on signals by our circuits,
namely filters, amplifiers, transistors,  etc. and what methods we used to find
appropriate values. The first and second weeks of results are the most
complete because the third week's supplies were malfunctioning, rendering
data collection regarding John-Nyquist noise impossible, but we did manage to understand how to use
code to get a better understanding of the central limit theorem and the
use of larger data samples to get more accurate results.

\section{Introduction}
At this current stage, we have circuits,  which are a tool for
transferring current from one place to another, in Radio Astronomy 

\section{Methods}

\subsection{The Voltage Divider}
In this activity of the lab, we constructed the simplest of circuits to
see how voltage can affected by two resistors(both of the same
resistance,$ 820 \Omega$, as there were no $1000 \Omega$ resistors present) put in series. The effect
is to have the incoming voltage be a fraction of what it originally was
once it has passed through both resistors. When we measured the voltage
out, we found the voltage to be 2.5 Volts, half of the incoming voltage
of 5 Volts that was applied. 

\subsection{Impedance}
Impedance is defined as the amount of opposition a circuit has to a
current when some DC voltage is applied. For resistors, it is fairly
easy to calculate since impedance is resistance for a resistor. In
general, impedance is the general form of Ohm's law
\begin{equation}
  \label{Ohm's}
  V = IR,
\end{equation}
when extended for components like capacitors, and inductors. Impedance generalizes this law by presenting V and I (the Voltage and Current) as
complex waveforms. In regards to the voltage
divider above,  it would be a good idea to have a high impedance when
you are applying a large DC voltage across a circuit, this is to prevent
excess voltage from damaging componenets down the circuit. And as for
lower applied volatges, it would be better to have low impedance,
otherwise you would end up blocking too much of the current thus
blocking any attempt to measure any relevant data you may want. 

\subsection{Capacitor}
\begin{equation}
  \label{Current for Capacitors}
  I = C \frac{dV}{dt}.
\end{equation}
The purpose of a capacitor is store energy in an electric field between
the plates of the capacitor. This acts to eventually stop current from
getting through if the voltage is constant, as seen in the equation \ref{Current for Capacitors}. But with and alternating current, a
displacement of current occurs. In regards to the impedance that this
contributes to a circuit, we use Z which is the relation for Voltage and
Capacitance. For resistance it is simply Z=R=V/I. But for capacitors,  Z
is given by 
\begin{equation}
  \label{impedance for Capacitors}
  Z_c = \frac{1}{jwC}
\end{equation}
where j is is the imaginary unit, and w is the frequency.

\subsection{RC Filters}
There are two varieties of filters, the high-pass and low-pass filters,
both of which make use of the imaginary, frequency-dependent impedences
of the capacitors. Both types have a charecteristic frequency at which
their frequency response evolves most rapidly, with a time-scale of
R*C. The frequency response of the filters is given by the cutoff
frequency at which a signal is attenuated at 3dB that frequency is
\begin{equation}
  \label{3dB frequency}
  w_{3db} =\frac{1}{RC}
\end{equation}

The designs for both a low pass and high pass filter are as follows.

\caption{a diagram of a high pass filter}
\label{high-pass filter}
\end{figure}

\subsection{LC filters}
Inductors are resistant to changes in current as seen in 
\begin{equation}
  \label{inductance voltage}
  V = L \frac{dI}{dt}
\end{equation}
where L is the inductance. when a current passes through, they store a
portion of the energy in their magnetic field. they behave like wire if
a current continuosly flows,  but once the current stops, the magnetic
field collapses, and so the energy stored goes into pushing electrons in
the direction they were flowing in. For a larger inductor, a larger
volatage is induced when the field collapses. The impedance of an
inductor is 
\begin{equation}
  \label{inductor impedance}
  Z_L = jwL
\end{equation}
For an RLC bandpass filter, it's purpose is to not allow a band 

\subsection{Diode}
A diode has nearly zero resistance to current flow in one direction and
bery high resistance in the other direction. Because of this, it serves
to convert alternating current into direct current, including modulation
(the varying a signal so that it may carry information in a waveform)
here namely an incoming fm signal so that the signal can be read. The
following is a table of data for a diode in series with a resistor,
which changed values for every set, and with a varying Voltage applied
across it.
